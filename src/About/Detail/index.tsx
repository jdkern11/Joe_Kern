      <h2>Who I am?</h2>
      <p>
        Hello, my name is Joe! I'm currently a graduate student at the Georgia 
        Institute of Technology, located in Atlanta. My research is centered around 
        designing recylable plastics (also known as synthetic polymers) 
        using machine learning and custom software I develop.
      </p>
      <h2>What I do?</h2>
      <p>
        In the course of my research endeavors, I've engaged with a broad spectrum of 
        subjects. This includes the development of sophisticated machine learning 
        models geared towards accurately predicting the solubility of polymers in 
        diverse solvents, complemented by the design of APIs to enable
        accessibility to these models. Additionally, I've constructed
        relational databases adept at housing intricate polymer and molecule data,
        and I've ventured into the realm of advanced genetic algorithms and 
        virtual forward synthesis techniques, all in pursuit of innovating the design 
        process for novel polymers.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm particularly passionate about programming! There's a unique joy in 
        discovering an engineering challenge and then crafting software to elegantly 
        surmount it. It's not just a profession for me; it's a passion that extends 
        into my free time, where I find genuine delight in exploring new projects and 
        pushing the boundaries of what's possible with software :)
