          Completely optional, there is no expectation that any gift or donations are 
          given! If you wish, in lieu of items, we ask you to give money
          for one of two things: funds to do exciting stuff on our honeymoon to Japan 
          or donations to one of the charities listed below!

        <h2>Honeymoon Fund</h2>
