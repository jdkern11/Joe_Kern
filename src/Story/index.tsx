Joe was struck not only by Camilla's beauty and intellect, but also by her wonderful smile and humor.

          As their paths intertwined during campus tours, Joe strategically found his way into the group Camilla was leading. The topic of condos became the bridge to their budding connection.

Little did he know, this playful ruse would set the foundation for something extraordinary.

          Amidst the lockdown's uncertainty, Joe's initial intention to learn about condos quickly evolved. They bonded over Netflix's madness, Tiger King, and Joe ingeniously arranged showings with a realtor, crafting reasons to visit Camilla without overwhelming her. It was through this charming deception that Joe accidentally found himself purchasing a home.
