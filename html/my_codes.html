            <p>
               The first scientific program I wrote was in MATLAB! I was
               a wee little undergrad at Madison doing research on some metal
               super-alloys. We decided to utilize electron dispersion 
               spectroscopy (EDS) to analyze the chemical compositions of the
               materials, and Dave Grierson (a visiting scientist at 
               Madison/super cool guy) suggested we analyze the data manaully.
               For that reason, we wrote this EDS code!

            <p>
               This is an image of the interface! The program reads in some EDS
               csv files and then displays a grey image of the sample. The user
               can then perform an assortment of analyses of the sample. These
               include:

                     src="../Images/eds_figures/Figure_4.png"
                     alt="Image of EDS code interface">
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>and, my personal favorite, threshold mapping!!</p>
                <img class="content-image"

            </ul>
            <p>
               This was my first ever custom program, so it always has a special
               place in my heart &lt;3. I wrote the code for the interface, 
               the loading of the data, for performing
               the threshold mapping, converting between atomic and weight 
               percentage, and choosing elements to view data on. Dave and I 
               collaborated on the line-scan code, element mapping, and 
               region-of-interest analysis (with him doing a lot of the more
               complicated math parts haha). Dave also added the ROI list, 
               Full view, and Zoom parts. 
            </p>
            <p>
               It was a useful tool for our EDS analyses! We used the outputs
               in a number of publications. The source code is on my github
               page as well for people to use. I would like to publish it, but
               the work isn't really novel, so maybe I can submit to an open
               source software journal sometime instead.
            </p>
            <p>
               In hindsight, I would have preferred to write this software in
               Python. It is open source and a much better programming language,
               in my opinion. I actually kind of despise MATLAB now haha. Still,
               when I wrote this code, I didn't know how to write anything in
               Python, and I only recently started making graphic user 
               interfaces (GUIs) in Python.
            </p>
            <p>
               I also would have tried to make the code more user friendly. A
               lot of the analyses depend on color, which makes it inaccessible
               to colorblind people. I try to be more concious of that these
               days. If people were ever interested in it, I'd be happy to 
               add additional improvements, although, I'm not sure I still have
               access to a MATLAB subscription :)
