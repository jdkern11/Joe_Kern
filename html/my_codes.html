              I would decribe this program as my first useful contribution to
              the Ramprasad group at GaTech. Lihua Chen (a postdoc in the group
              and super cool person) designed an algorithm that takes a polymer
              as input and then outputs predicted reactants and a 
              score indicating the ease to synthesize it. I was initially 
              tasked with designing the front and backend interface for this 
              program.
            </p>

              Users would input a target polymer with the smiles string and
              user defined variables being passed back to my flask app that 
              interfaced
              with Lihua's code. I then used rdkit to generate images of the
              target polymer and predicted reactants, and returned the
              relative synthesizability score her code generated, 
              with high representing a score &#62; 0.7 on a scale of 0 to 1. 
              After this I used html 
              templates and jinja to append a table to the end of the page.

              Tragically, we never used this design, as we wanted to integrate
              the code with <a href='https://www.polymergenome.org'>
              Polymer Genome</a>. Still, I got to learn how to use jinja, and 
              it was great practice for my html/css (you'll notice I was very
              effective at duplicating the Polymer Genome aesthetic for my 
              original app interface :).
              My Flask backend was still used, 
              although I had to modify it to return json of the images and 
              scores so Chiho (another cool person/research scientist) 
              could make the table in Polymer Genome.

              The last interesting bit about this program was I got to learn how
              to deploy the backend using kuberetes, openshift, and docker. 
              This was
              more challenging than I was expecting, but still fun. The hardest
              part was figuring out how to give the correct user id
              permissions in the Dockerfile so they would transfer over to the
              openshift account GaTech set up for me. Shout out to Mark 
              Danielson who was super helpful in teaching me how to do it.

            <h2 id='eds-code'>Electron Dispersion Spectroscopy</h2>
            <p>
              The first scientific program I wrote was in MATLAB I was
              a wee little undergrad at Madison doing research on some metal
              super-alloys. We decided to utilize electron dispersion 
              spectroscopy (EDS) to analyze the chemical compositions of the
              materials, and Dave Grierson (a visiting scientist at 
              Madison/super cool guy) suggested we analyze the data with our
              own software. For that reason, we wrote this EDS code.             
            </p>
            <img class="content-image" src="../Images/eds_figures/Figure_1.png"
                 alt="Image of EDS code interface">
            <p>
              This is an image of the interface! The program reads in some EDS
              csv files and then displays a grey image of the sample. The user
              can then perform an assortment of analyses of the sample. These
              include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Element/Oxide mapping,</p>

                     src="../Images/eds_figures/Figure_2.png"
                     alt="Image of EDS code interface">
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>linescans with width-averaging,</p>
                <img class="content-image" 
                     src="../Images/eds_figures/Figure_3.png"
                     alt="Image of EDS code interface">
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>region-of-interest analyses,</p>
                <img class="content-image" 
                     src="../Images/eds_figures/Figure_4.png"
                     alt="Image of EDS code interface">
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>and, my personal favorite, threshold mapping!</p>
                <img class="content-image" 
                     src="../Images/eds_figures/Figure_5.png"

              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This was my first ever custom program, so it always has a special
              place in my heart &lt;3. I wrote the code for the interface, 
              the loading of the data, for performing
              the threshold mapping, converting between atomic and weight 
              percentage, and choosing elements to view data on. Dave and I 
              collaborated on the line-scan code, element mapping, and 
              region-of-interest analysis. Dave also added the ROI list, 
              Full view, and Zoom parts. 
            </p>
            <p>
              It was a useful tool for our EDS analyses. We used the outputs
              in a number of publications. The source code is on my github
              page as well for people to use. I would like to publish it, but
              the work isn't really novel, so maybe I can submit to an open
              source software journal sometime instead.
            </p>
            <p>
              In hindsight, I would have preferred to write this software in
              Python since it is open source. Still,
              when I wrote this code, I didn't know how to write anything in
              Python, and only in 2020 did I start making graphic user 
              interfaces in Python with tkinter and Qt5. Dave also didn't know
              Python, so MATLAB was best suited to the job at the time.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also would have tried to make the code more user friendly. A
              lot of the analyses depend on color, which makes it inaccessible
              to colorblind people. I try to be more concious of that these
              days. If people were ever interested in it, I'd be happy to 
              add additional improvements though.
